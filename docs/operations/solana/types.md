# Types

Chainstack currently supports deploying a Solana node of the following types: 
*  Elastic - a highly scalable public network node infrastructure accessed through your exclusive endpoint.
*  Dedicated - a dedicated node that is exclusive to you. This is currently only available when on [Chainstack Cloud](/glossary/chainstack-cloud). 

With an elastic node, you pay for JSON-RPC requests to the node and do not pay for the compute and storage resources used by the node.

With a dedicated node, you pay for the compute and storage resources used by the node and do not pay for JSON-RPC requests to the node.
