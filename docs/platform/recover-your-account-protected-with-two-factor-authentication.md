# Recover your account protected with two-factor authentication

When you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Chainstack account, you are provided with a list of recovery codes.

These are the backup codes that you must use to restore your 2FA access if you lose it.

The default name of the file that you might have downloaded with the recovery codes is `recoveryCodes.txt`.

To recover your account:

1. Provide your username and password at the <a href="https://console.chainstack.com/" target="_blank">log in</a> page.
1. Click **Having problems? Enter your recovery code.**
1. Provide your recovery code. Click **Verify**.

::: warning

Each recovery code can only be used once.
