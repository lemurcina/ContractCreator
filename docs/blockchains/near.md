# NEAR

NEAR is a Layer 1 blockchain protocol that uses its own sharding technology called Nightshade and is secured by staking-based consensus. For block production, NEAR is also using its own technology called Doomslug.

## Consensus

NEAR is using the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm with the possibility for network users to delegate their stake to validators.
